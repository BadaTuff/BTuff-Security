# Welcome to BTuff Security

## Breaking Into Cybersecurity Through Persistence

Hey! I'm **Muhiz "BTuff" Bada**, and I'm documenting my journey from student to SOC/Blue-Team Analyst in real-time. Every week I publish practical security work while pursuing OSCP and Security Blue Team's BTL1 certification simultaneously.

### What Makes This Different?

- **Evidence Over Polish** - You'll see the mistakes, the fixes, and the real learning process
- **Practical & Applicable** - Every concept is tied to real-world SOC/Blue-Team work
- **Consistent Weekly Output** - New content every week, no matter what
- **Teaching to Learn** - I explain what I'm learning to deepen my understanding

## Latest Weekly Letter

### Coming Soon: Week 01 (November 2025)

The journey officially begins next week! Week 01 will cover:

- OSCP methodology and initial labs
- Starting BTL1 Certficate - fundamentals and detection concepts
- Setting up my learning environment
- First practical examples and runbooks

**Subscribe on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@BTuffSecurity) to follow along with video demonstrations & more on the week!**

## What You'll Find Here

### Weekly Letters
In-depth reflections combining OSCP and BTL1 learning. Each letter includes:
- Technical concepts explained clearly
- Practical lab examples and walkthroughs
- How to apply skills to real SOC/Blue-Team roles
- Challenges faced and lessons learned

### Practical Artifacts
Real work you'd do in a security role:
- Detection rules and runbooks
- Scripts and automation tools
- Network analysis and log investigations
- Incident response procedures

### The Learning Process
I document everything - successes and failures. If I struggle with a concept, you'll see how I work through it. If a lab breaks, you'll see how I troubleshoot it.

## Why "Evidence Over Polish"?

In cybersecurity, demonstrating capability matters more than perfect presentation. I'm building a portfolio of real work that shows:

1. **Consistency** - Showing up every week
2. **Problem-Solving** - Working through challenges
3. **Communication** - Explaining technical concepts clearly
4. **Initiative** - Self-directed learning and research
5. **Persistence** - The #1 skill for breaking into cyber
